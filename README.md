# AwesomeExplorer (AweXplor)

Welcome to [AwesomeExplorer (AweXplor)](https://awexplor.github.io/) â€“ the ultimate tool for exploring GitHub's awesome lists with ease and efficiency!

## What is AwesomeExplorer?

AwesomeExplorer is a web application designed to enhance the way you browse GitHub's awesome lists. AweXplor transforms these plain text lists into an interactive, user-friendly interface where you can easily sort, filter, and discover projects based on various criteria.

## Features

**Interactive Browsing**: Navigate through awesome lists with a sleek, intuitive interface that displays repository names, descriptions, star counts, recent update times, tags, and owners.

**Advanced Sorting**: Sort projects by popularity or activity to quickly find the most popular or recently active repositories.

**Filtering**: Narrow down your search by filtering out unmaintained or overly popular repositories.

**Mobile Friendly**: Enjoy a responsive design that ensures seamless browsing on any device, including smartphones and tablets.

## Getting Started

To start using AwesomeExplorer, simply visit our website https://awexplor.github.io/ and begin exploring your favorite awesome lists with newfound ease and efficiency.

## Explorerable repositories

Currently, we feature a selection of popular awesome list projects due to GitHub API rate limits and the limited number of API tokens available. If you'd like to see a specific awesome list repository included, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AweXplor/awexplor.github.io/issues/new) and we will consider adding it.
